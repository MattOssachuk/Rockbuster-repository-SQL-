# Rockbuster Stealth LLC PostgreSQL Querying Project

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

For this analysis I'll be sing a data set that contains information about Rockbusterâ€™s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. This data set was provided to me by the
company and I will connect to it using Pgadmin4 (a management tool for PostgreSQL) and SQL to query 
the database.
